# **Winter Clothing Donation Website**

## **Project Purpose**  
The **Winter Clothing Donation Website** is a simple and easy-to-use platform that helps people donate winter clothing to those in need across Bangladesh. 
When the weather gets colder, thousands of vulnerable people, especially in rural and low-income areas, struggle to stay warm because they donâ€™t have enough warm clothing. 
This website will connect donors with volunteers for these people, making it easy for users to donate clothes and bring warmth to those who need it most. Users will see the donation campaign and browse details after login and can donate via the form. 

This designed to connect donors with those in need during the cold season. It provides a seamless platform for managing donation campaigns, ensuring that essential winter clothing items like jackets, blankets, and sweaters reach those in need.
